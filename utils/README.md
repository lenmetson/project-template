# WSL-Dropbox Workflow

## Overview
When working with Dropbox and WSL, file watching and syncing can be slow. This workflow copies projects to WSL for fast local development, then syncs changes back to Dropbox.

## Initial Setup

### 1. Copy project from Dropbox to WSL
```bash
cp -r /mnt/c/Users/USERNAME/Dropbox/PATH/TO/PROJECT /home/USERNAME/wsl-projs/
```

### 2. Configure sync script
Update the variables in the sync script:
- `WSL_PROJECT_PATH`: Your WSL project location (e.g., `~/wsl-projs/project-name/`)
- `DROPBOX_PATH`: Your Dropbox destination (e.g., `/mnt/c/Users/USERNAME/Dropbox/PATH/TO/PROJECT/`)
- `PROJECT_NAME`: Your project name

### 3. Make script executable
```bash
chmod +x sync-to-dropbox.sh
```

## Workflow

1. **Work locally in WSL** - Make all changes in `~/wsl-projs/project-name/`
2. **Sync regularly** - Run `./sync-to-dropbox.sh` to push changes to Dropbox
3. **Changes appear in Dropbox** - Files are reflected in the mounted Dropbox folder

## Benefits
- Fast file operations in WSL
- No Dropbox sync delays during development
- R/Python packages cached locally
- Dropbox backup maintained

## Excluded from sync
- `renv/` directories (library, staging, cache, local)
- R project files (.Rproj.user, .Rhistory, .RData, .Ruserdata)
- Add more exclusions in the script arrays as needed
